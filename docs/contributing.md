# Contributing to BiblioDrift 📚☕

Thanks for taking the time to contribute.

BiblioDrift is a cozy, visual-first book discovery platform. Contributions should improve the calm, shelf-based browsing experience without breaking the existing mood-driven flow.

## What You Can Contribute

- Bug fixes
- UI and accessibility improvements
- Better mood or search logic
- AI note and recommendation refinements
- Documentation updates
- Test coverage for important flows

## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you are familiar with the current stack:

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Backend:** Python
- **API Source:** Google Books API

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.9+ if you plan to run the backend
2. A modern web browser
3. Git

### Local Setup

1. Fork the repository if you plan to contribute from your own account.
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/BiblioDrift.git
   cd BiblioDrift
   ```
3. Setting up upstream (recommended to keep your fork synchronized):
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/devanshi14malhotra/BiblioDrift
   ```
   Keeping your fork up-to-date:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main
   ```
   **Important** to do before any contribution.

3. Setup your python environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```
4. Activate your virtual environment:
   ```bash
   #Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate

   #Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
   Verify virtual environment is active:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   Your terminal should now show `(.venv)` at the beginning.
5. Setting up pip:
   ```bash
   python -m ensurepip --upgrade
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   ```
6. Verify pip:
   ```bash
   python -m pip --version
   ```
7. Install backend dependencies if needed:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
8. Run the app or open the frontend directly:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Or open `index.html` in your browser for frontend-only changes.

## Bug Reports

1. Keep changes focused and easy to review.
2. Test your changes locally before submitting.
3. Update documentation if behavior or setup changes.
4. Include screenshots for visible UI changes.
5. Reference the related issue if one exists.

## Code Style

- Keep the frontend vanilla unless a change explicitly needs otherwise.
- Preserve the calm, tactile visual style.
- Follow existing Python style and naming patterns.
